# Designing Solutions and Solution Processes

## I. Designing Solutions

When we are designing solutions, we often use a <b> design thinking model </b>, even if we don't
always realize it. Design thinking is described by different models, but we'll be looking at
the five-step model that is most commonly seen when using design thinking.

In conjunction with computational thinking, the design thinking process can help us
evolve our ideas before we start diagramming solutions. It should be noted that we don't
go through the design thinking process linearly, much like in computational thinking.
Think about the steps in computational thinking:

- Problem decomposition
- Pattern recognition
- Abstraction
- Algorithm design

The design thinking model works the same way. It was designed by the Hasso-Plattner
Institute of Design at Stanford University. The main steps of the model include the
following:

- <b> Empathize </b>: Understand the problem from the audience or stakeholder perspective.
- <b> Define </b>: Identify the objectives, the decisions that need to be made, any biases
introduced, and any details pertaining to the problem.
- <b> Ideate </b>: Brainstorm ideas, which go with the diagramming we'll be doing in the next
section of this part.
- <b> Prototype </b>: Design the algorithm solution and check it often.
- <b> Test </b>: Check your algorithm often throughout the process and go back to previous
steps as needed.

As you can see, I've adapted the design thinking model to align more with a
computational thinking process. The main goal when we're using these models and
combining them is to break down the harder problems into simpler chunks so we can
solve and design the best algorithms. This does not take the place of computational
thinking. It simply provides a better idea of how we can address the process. The following
diagram can help demonstrate how the process may work:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/CS/CS-14.png?raw=true)

As you can see, rather than using the linear model most frequently shown, the preceding
model shows the process as <i> cyclical </i>. That said, going back to <i> empathize </i> can happen from
any point, so going back and forth between these steps is the best way to use the design
thinking model.

Let's take a look at a scenario where we are using design thinking in conjunction with
computational thinking.

### Problem 1 - A marketing survey

Let's say you're working with a marketing firm and they ask you to put together a survey
to gather feedback about a website. Here are some of the steps you may go through:

1. <b> Identifying stakeholders </b>: This includes the people you'll survey as well as the
people who will use the information after the survey, for example.
2. <b> Identifying questions </b>: This is where you define what information you hope to find
from the survey.
3. <b> Designing the survey </b>: This includes not only the questions you identified but the
aesthetics of what the survey will look like.
4. <b> Information gathering </b>: This is where you decide how you will communicate with
the people who will fill out the survey, such as email, a link on a website, or similar.
5. <b> Data analysis </b>: You can write a Python algorithm to help you with data analysis,
including creating tables and graphs based on the data collected.
6. <b> Data sharing </b>: This is where you will plan the visuals, reports, and data presentation
to the original stakeholders.

Let's be clear: this is an oversimplification of the process. But let's say you realize you need
to include another group for the survey. Say you were only initially getting feedback from
students at a school but realized you wanted to add teachers and parents. Well, then you
would go back to <b> step 1 </b> and identify in which ways the rest of your information would be
affected. You may want to change the look of the survey or add a different one for adults
versus children. You may need to add questions that are for only one group, which affects
your decision-making in the algorithm for the survey.

Now let's take a look at these steps within the design thinking process.

For our problem, identifying the stakeholders and questions are part of <b> steps 1, 2, </b> and <b> 3 </b> of the design thinking model: <b> empathize </b>, <b> define </b>, and <b> ideate </b>. Building the algorithm
is both part of <b> prototype </b> and <b> test </b>, which are <b> steps 4 </b> and <b> 5 </b>. Adding people to the survey
takes us back to <b> steps 1â€“3 </b>. And the cycle repeats until we have a working algorithm for
our scenarios. Throughout the computational thinking model and using its elements,
you'll use the design thinking process embedded within. It's a natural part of the
decision-making process.

Now that we've looked at the design thinking model, let's take a look at how to visually
represent the decision-making using diagramming solutions.

## II. Diagramming Solutions

When we are designing algorithms, we often use diagrams and flowcharts to help us
analyze the process and visually see where our decisions are made. These diagrams allow
us to create better algorithms.

The process of creating these diagrams varies by developer or coder. For example,
I usually create a brainstorm for the problem, then a flowchart from that information.
To look at that process, let's go back to our survey problem from earlier in this chapter.
Look at the following brainstorm. It is not complete, as you can add a lot of sub-topics.
This brainstorm assumes we are surveying stakeholders to evaluate and share feedback
on a school website.

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/CS/CS-15.png?raw=true)

As you can see from the diagram, there are many considerations to be made. The actual
survey design may be provided to us as programmers or we may take part in designing the
survey. If we have the survey, our brainstorm may look different, as we navigate through
the questions and decide how to best place them within the algorithm. This is part of
the empathizing process. We are looking at our information from multiple angles, from
multiple stakeholders' perspectives, and deciding how we'll write an algorithm to help us
get to where we need. The purpose of an informal diagram such as the brainstorm is that
it allows us to begin organizing ideas before trying to create a more detailed and organized
flowchart. When we work on the diagram, we are defining and ideating our algorithm.
That's why it's important to sketch out our plans before beginning to code directly.

With regard to flowcharts, we saw a few in the last chapter when discussing the creation of
a store in Python. Now let's take a look at a flowchart for decision-making based on some
decisions.

It is important to note that surveys can be difficult to create from scratch. Part of the
reason is that there may be questions that depend on each other. For example, let's say you
ask the user to state whether they approve of the color choices or not. If they do, you can
move on. But if they don't, you may want to provide other color schemes for review. That
question would only appear for those who choose the No option. Our flowchart could
be rather complicated if we were to tackle all the information for our brainstorm, so we'll
focus on a few questions within the Look category of the brainstorm. Take a look at the
following flowchart:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/CS/CS-16.png?raw=true)

As you can see from the flowchart, some things are not clearly visible, such as what
happens when you complete one question, where you go after each decision, and so on.
When I create flowcharts, I sometimes add arrows to help me see what happens after each
step. The following flowchart shows some of the arrows added:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/CS/CS-17.png?raw=true)

As can be seen from the preceding flowchart, not all arrows are added, but look closely at
<b> Color Scheme </b>. If a user approves of the color scheme, then they go directly to the <b> Fonts
</b> section. If they don't, they are shown options. Assuming one option is shown at a time,
then the user would go to <b> Fonts </b> after they choose one they like. It is also possible to add
a prompt that asks the user if they'd like to see the options again, which would bring them
back to the <b> Alt option 1 </b>. Arrows can be added to show those details.

It all depends on what is easiest for you as a developer and programmer to understand
yourself. Think of these as your journal notes if you were a writer. The way you organize
your ideas can be personal, just make sure your end result and algorithm can be easily
used by the people it is intended for.

Now let's take a look at how to put everything together and create solutions to some
problems.

## III. Creating Solutions

When we are presented with problems, we want to create solutions that address the
information we have been provided, with an algorithm that provides everything needed
and that is easily understood by the user. In this section, we'll take the content we've been
learning in this chapter in order to design solutions to problems.

As we create these solutions using our brainstorms and flowcharts, we should be
considering the following:

- <i> Does the solution we have planned address the problem? </i>
- <i> Does the solution design show a clear path for the algorithm to be successful? </i>

And if the answers to those questions are yes, then we can start coding the solution.
Remember, we need to test the algorithm as often as we can. Here are some things to keep
in mind when writing the algorithm:

- Add comments to identify sections you may need to go back to and that clearly
help to identify and define your variables, dictionaries, functions, and any key
components.
- Check that you don't have any errors.
- Run your program as often as possible to test for errors.

For the solution process, we're going to use a slightly different problem than the survey
we were working on earlier in the chapter. We will tackle components you can use for that
problem as we go through this book, such as adding images, showing graphics, and more.
But for now, let's stick with some more basic Python in order to practice the process of
creating a solution.

### Problem 2 - Pizza order

I know â€“ food. But it's one of the best ways to demonstrate logic and algorithm creation,
so bear with me. Let's say we have a pizzeria. We sell only one type of crust because we're
a specialty kind of place. We sell two different sizes of pizza: personal and family. There are
two sauce options: marinara and garlic cream. There are three cheese options: no cheese,
regular cheese, and extra cheese.

There are five toppings to choose from (I'm limiting those because we're just learning the
process): mushrooms, pepperoni, Italian sausage, onions, and peppers. And no, we're not
putting olives anywhere near my pizzeria.

Let's break down that problem. We want an algorithm to capture the options chosen by
the user to order their pizza. Things we're not going to take into consideration right now
are cost and additional items in the order, such as an additional pizza, beverages, desserts,
and so on.

Here's what we know:
- <b> Size </b>: personal or family
- <b> Sauce </b>: marinara or garlic cream
- <b> Cheese </b>: no cheese, regular cheese, extra cheese
- <b> Toppings </b>: mushrooms, pepperoni, Italian sausage, onions, peppers

Now that we have that, let's look at a flowchart with the information:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/CS/CS-18.png?raw=true)

As you can see, the figure shows a fairly <i> linear decision-making process </i> for this particular
problem. One thing we haven't considered is asking the user if they wish to make any
changes. That may need to happen at each step. Say you changed your mind while
choosing cheese to go for a marinara instead of a garlic cream sauce. You'll need to have
a way to go back, so we'll need to keep that in mind as we create the algorithm.

Keep in mind that we're sticking to text codes currently, so we'll use input from the user
in numbers and letters for now. However, there are ways to incorporate Python into more
robust algorithms that incorporate images, buttons, and more.

Take a look at the following snippet from the algorithm:

```python
# Get input for your variables for size and sauce first. 

size_choice = str(input("Is this a personal or family pizza? Type personal or family. "))

sauce_choice = str(input("Which sauce would you like? Marinara or garlic cream? Type m for marinara and g for garlic cream. "))
if sauce_choice == "g":
    sauce = "garlic cream"
else:
    sauce = "marinara"

# The cheese choice will dictate a few more options. Define the variable first.                
cheese_choice = str(input("Would you like cheese on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. "))
```

Notice in the snippet that we defined the size and the sauce first. I will reiterate here that
there are other ways to tackle this particular logic process. For example, we can save
some of the variables to dictionaries and work with arrays. For now, we're using what
we've learned so far to create our algorithms, but we'll get a chance to learn about other
approaches later in this book.

Take a look at the following snippet with those options, which is a continuation of the
preceding code:

```python
# Toppings need to happen whether or not you want cheese. 
if cheese_choice == "y":
    cheese2_choice = str(input("Would you like regular cheese or extra cheese? Type r for regular and e for extra cheese. "))
    if cheese2_choice == "r":
        cheese = "regular cheese"
    else:
        cheese = "extra cheese"
    toppings1_input = str(input("Would you like mushrooms on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. "))
    if toppings1_input == "y":
        toppings1 = "mushrooms"
    else:
        toppings1 = "no mushrooms"
else:
    cheese = "no cheese"
    

if cheese_choice == "n":
    toppings1_input = str(input("Would you like mushrooms on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. "))
    if toppings1_input == "y":
        toppings1 = "mushrooms"
    else:
        toppings1 = "no mushrooms"


print("You want a " + size_choice + " pizza with " + sauce + " sauce, " + cheese + ", and " + toppings1 + ".")
```

As you can see from the snippet, we only worked with mushrooms. The output for this
particular code after choosing family size, garlic sauce, regular cheese, and mushrooms
looks as follows:

```
Is this a personal or family pizza? Type personal or family.family
Which sauce would you like? Marinara or garlic cream? Type m for marinara and g for garlic cream. g
Would you like cheese on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. y
Would you like regular cheese or extra cheese? Type r for regular and e for extra cheese. r
Would you like mushrooms on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. y
You want a family pizza with garlic cream sauce, regular cheese, and mushrooms.
```

Using the code provided and taking a look at the output, try to put together the rest of
the code for the remaining four ingredients. And I guess that if you are creating your own
pizza, you're welcome to change the options provided here. Just keep the olives to yourself.

Now, as mentioned before, we may need to go back and make changes. Let's take a look at
a snippet that does that for you:

```python
ready_end = str(input("Do you need to make any changes? Type y for yes and n for no. "))
if ready_end == "y":
    size_choice = str(input("Is this a personal or family pizza? Type 1 for personal and 2 for family. "))

    sauce_choice = str(input("Which sauce would you like? Marinara or garlic cream? Type m for marinara and g for garlic cream. "))
    if sauce_choice == "g":
        sauce = "garlic cream"
    else:
        sauce = "marinara"
                
    cheese_choice = str(input("Would you like cheese on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. "))
```

As you can see from the snippet of code, there is a decision that needs to be made about
the changes needed. If yes, then we present the questions again. If no, then we print the
choices for the user. Take a look at the following output with the fully run program:

```
Is this a personal or family pizza? Type personal or family.family
Which sauce would you like? Marinara or garlic cream? Type m for marinara and g for garlic cream. g
Would you like cheese on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. n
Would you like mushrooms on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. y
Do you need to make any changes? Type y for yes and n for no. y
Is this a personal or family pizza? Type 1 for personal and 2 for family. family
Which sauce would you like? Marinara or garlic cream? Type m for marinara and g for garlic cream. m
Would you like cheese on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. n
Would you like mushrooms on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. y
You want a family pizza with marinara sauce, no cheese, and mushrooms.
```

As shown in the code, the questions were asked twice because we made a change in our
options. Depending on how often you want to ask that question, you'll need to continue
to repeat some of this code.

Full code:

```python
# Get input for your variables for size and sauce first. 

size_choice = str(input("Is this a personal or family pizza? Type personal or family. "))

sauce_choice = str(input("Which sauce would you like? Marinara or garlic cream? Type m for marinara and g for garlic cream. "))
if sauce_choice == "g":
    sauce = "garlic cream"
else:
    sauce = "marinara"

# The cheese choice will dictate a few more options. Define the variable first.                
cheese_choice = str(input("Would you like cheese on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. "))
                
# Toppings need to happen whether or not you want cheese. 
if cheese_choice == "y":
    cheese2_choice = str(input("Would you like regular cheese or extra cheese? Type r for regular and e for extra cheese. "))
    if cheese2_choice == "r":
        cheese = "regular cheese"
    else:
        cheese = "extra cheese"
    toppings1_input = str(input("Would you like mushrooms on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. "))
    if toppings1_input == "y":
        toppings1 = "mushrooms"
    else:
        toppings1 = "no mushrooms"
else:
    cheese = "no cheese"
    

if cheese_choice == "n":
    toppings1_input = str(input("Would you like mushrooms on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. "))
    if toppings1_input == "y":
        toppings1 = "mushrooms"
    else:
        toppings1 = "no mushrooms"

ready_end = str(input("Do you need to make any changes? Type y for yes and n for no. "))
if ready_end == "y":
    size_choice = str(input("Is this a personal or family pizza? Type 1 for personal and 2 for family. "))

    sauce_choice = str(input("Which sauce would you like? Marinara or garlic cream? Type m for marinara and g for garlic cream. "))
    if sauce_choice == "g":
        sauce = "garlic cream"
    else:
        sauce = "marinara"
                
    cheese_choice = str(input("Would you like cheese on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. "))

    if cheese_choice == "y":
        cheese2_choice = str(input("Would you like regular cheese or extra cheese? Type r for regular and e for extra cheese. "))
        if cheese2_choice == "r":
            cheese = "regular cheese"
        else:
            cheese = "extra cheese"
        toppings1_input = str(input("Would you like mushrooms on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. "))
        if toppings1_input == "y":
            toppings1 = "mushrooms"
        else:
            toppings1 = "no mushrooms"
    else:
        cheese = "no cheese"
        

    if cheese_choice == "n":
        toppings1_input = str(input("Would you like mushrooms on your pizza? Type y for yes and n for no. "))
        if toppings1_input == "y":
            toppings1 = "mushrooms"
        else:
            toppings1 = "no mushrooms"
    print("You want a " + size_choice + " pizza with " + sauce + " sauce, " + cheese + ", and " + toppings1 + ".")
else:
     print("You want a " + size_choice + " pizza with " + sauce + " sauce, " + cheese + ", and " + toppings1 + ".")
```

### Problem 3 - Delays and Python

One of my first problems in Python was to create an algorithm that would react differently
depending on the color chosen. This is similar to what you'd have if you were creating
a traffic light. Each light has a different delay. So let's create an algorithm that addresses
that. We'll make it a user-chosen color between green, yellow, and red, just to keep the
traffic light theme. So let's put some assumptions together:

- Green will mean a 5-second delay
- Yellow will mean a 2-second delay
- Red will mean a 4-second delay

There's no reason for these specific delays; I just wanted to keep them all under 5 seconds.
Now, let's say that we're playing a game and the user has to choose a color. If they choose
yellow or red, they'll get a delay and then will be asked again. The goal is to get a <i> You win! You can go now </i> message from the program. So let's create a flowchart for this:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/CS/CS-19.png?raw=true)

As you can see from the flowchart, the game restarts if you choose yellow or red. Now that
we have the basics of what the game will look like, we have to code it.

```python
import time

print("Let's play a game. Choose a color to learn your destiny. Choose wisely or you'll have to start over. ")


i = 0
while i < 4:
    color = str(input("Choose a color: red, green, or yellow. "))
    if color == "green":
        print("You must wait 5 seconds to learn your fate.")
        time.sleep(5)
        print("You win! Excellent choice!")
        break
    elif color == "yellow":
        print("You must wait 2 seconds to learn your fate.")
        time.sleep(2)
        print("You lose! You must start over.")
        i = i + 1
    else:
        print("You must wait 4 seconds to learn your fate.")
        time.sleep(4)
        print("You lose! You must start over.")
        i = i + 1

```
As you can see, the algorithm contains some of the code we've looked at in previous
chapters when talking about loops, Boolean statements, and more. This particular code
returns to the beginning for three rounds if the user has not won the game. We used an
if-elif-else statement to go through the color scenarios. The output of the game
playing three rounds looks as follows:

```
Let's play a game. Choose a color to learn your destiny. Choose wisely or you'll have to start over.
Choose a color: red, green, or yellow. yellow
You must wait 2 seconds to learn your fate.
You lose! You must start over.
Choose a color: red, green, or yellow. red
You must wait 4 seconds to learn your fate.
You lose! You must start over.
Choose a color: red, green, or yellow. green
You must wait 5 seconds to learn your fate.
You win! Excellent choice!
```

As you can see from the game output, all three rounds were played. Each delay happened
according to the statement, which you'll have to test for yourself since I can't show time
delays with text.

Having the flowchart made creating this algorithm simpler than if I'd started coding as
soon as I'd read the problem. It's important to get used to fleshing out the processes you'll
need prior to writing your algorithms. Designing solutions can be a long and tedious
process, but the more organized we are at the start, the better our algorithms will be.
