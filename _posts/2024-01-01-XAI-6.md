# [XAI 6] - Human-Friendly Explanations with TCAV

In the previous few part, we have extensively discussed LIME and SHAP. You have
also seen the practical aspect of applying the Python frameworks of LIME and SHAP to
explain black-box models. One major limitation of both frameworks is that the method
of explanation is not extremely consistent and intuitive with how non-technical end users
would explain an observation. For example, if you have an image of a glass filled with
Coke and use LIME and SHAP to explain a black-box model used to correctly classify
the image as Coke, both LIME and SHAP would highlight regions of the image that lead
to the correct prediction by the trained model. But if you ask a non-technical user to
describe the image, the user would classify the image as Coke due to the presence of
a dark-colored carbonated liquid in a glass that resembles a Cola drink. In other words,
human beings tend to relate any observation with known concepts to explain it.

<b> Testing with Concept Activation Vector (TCAV) </b> from Google AI also follows a similar
approach in terms of explaining model predictions with known <i> human concepts </i>.

## I. Understanding TCAV intuitively

The idea of TCAV was first introduced by Kim et al. in their work â€“ [Interpretability beyond Feature Attribution: Quantitative Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11279.pdf). The framework was designed to
provide interpretability beyond feature attribution, particularly for deep learning
models that rely on low-level transformed features that are not human-interpretable.
TCAV aims to explain the opaque internal state of the deep learning model using
abstract, high-level, human-friendly concepts. In this section, I will present you with
an intuitive understanding of TCAV and explain how it works to provide
human-friendly explanations.

### 1. What is TCAV?

So far, we have covered many methods and frameworks to explain ML models through
feature-based approaches. But it might occur to you that since most ML models operate
on low-level features, the feature-based explanation approaches might highlight features
that are not human-interpretable. For example, for explaining image classifiers, pixel
intensity values or pixels coordinates in an image might not be useful for end users
without any technical background in data science and ML. So, these features are not userfriendly. Moreover, feature-based explanations are always restricted by the selection of
features and the number of features present in the dataset. Out of all the features selected
by the feature-based explanation methods, end users might be interested in a particular
feature that is not picked by the algorithm.

So, instead of this approach, concept-based approaches provide a much wider abstraction
that is human-friendly and more relevant as interpretability is provided in terms of the
importance of high-level concepts. So, <b> TCAV </b> is a model interpretability framework
from Google AI that implements the idea of a concept-based explanation method in
practice. The algorithm depends on <b> Concept Activation Vectors (CAV) </b>, which provide
an interpretation of the internal state of ML models using human-friendly concepts. In
a more technical sense, TCAV uses directional derivatives to quantify the importance of
human-friendly, high-level concepts for model predictions. For example, while describing
hairstyles, concepts such as <i> curly hair, straight hair, or hair color </i> can be used by TCAV.
These user-defined concepts are not the input features of the dataset that are used by the
algorithm during the training process

The following figure illustrates the key question addressed by TCAV:

In the next section, let's try to understand the idea of model explanation using
abstract concepts.

By now, you may have an intuitive understanding of the method of providing explanations
with abstract concepts. But why do you think this is an effective approach? Let's take
another example. Suppose you are working on building a deep learning-based image
classifier for detecting doctors from images. After applying TCAV, let's say that you have
found out that the <i> concept importance </i> of the concept white male is maximum, followed
by <i> stethoscope </i> and <i> white coat </i>. The concept importance of stethoscope and white coat is
expected, but the high concept importance of white male indicates a biased dataset. Hence,
TCAV can help to evaluate <b> fairness </b> in trained models.

Essentially, the goal of CAVs is to estimate the importance of a concept (such as color,
gender, and race) for the prediction of a trained model, even though the concepts were
not used during the model training process. This is because TCAV learns concepts from a
few example samples. For example, in order to learn a gender concept, TCAV needs a few
data instances that have a male concept and a few non-male examples. Hence, TCAV can
quantitatively estimate the trained model's sensitivity to a particular concept for that class.
For generating explanations, TCAV perturbs data points toward a concept that is relatable
to humans, and so it is a type of <b> global perturbation </b> method. Next, let's try to learn the
main objectives of TCAV.

### 2. Goals of TCAV

I found the approach of TCAV to be very unique as compared to other explanation
methods. One of the main reasons is because the developers of this framework established
clear goals that resonate with my own understanding of human-friendly explanations. The
following are the established goals of TCAV:

- <b> Accessibility </b>: The developers of TCAV wanted this approach to be accessible to any
end user, irrespective of their knowledge of ML or data science.

- <b> Customization </b>: The framework can adapt to any user-defined concept. This is not
limited to concepts considered during the training process.

- <b> Plug-in readiness </b>: The developers wanted this approach to work without the need
to retrain or fine-tune trained ML models.

- <b> Global interpretability </b>: TCAV can interpret the entire class or multiple samples
of the dataset with a single quantitative measure. It is not restricted to the local
explainability of data instances.

Now that we have an idea of what can be achieved using TCAV, let's discuss the general
approach to how TCAV works.

### 3. Approach of TCAV

In this section, we will cover the workings of TCAV in more depth. The overall workings
of this algorithm can be summarized in the following methods:

- Applying directional derivatives to quantitatively estimate the sensitivity of
predictions of trained ML models for various user-defined concepts.

- Computing the final quantitative explanation, which is termed <b> TCAVq measure </b>,
without any model re-training or fine-tuning. This measure is the relative
importance of each concept to each model prediction class.

Now, I will try to further simplify the approach of TCAV without using too many
mathematical notions. Let's assume we have a model for identifying zebras from images.
To apply TCAV, the following approach can be taken:

- <b> Defining a concept of interest </b>: The very first step is to consider the concepts of
interest. For our zebra classifier, either we can have a given set of examples that
represent the concept (such as black stripes are important in identifying a zebra) or
we can have an independent dataset with the concepts labeled. The major benefit
of this step is that it does not limit the algorithm from using features used by the
model. Even non-technical users or domain experts can define the concepts based
on their existing knowledge.

- <b> Learning concept activation vectors </b>: The algorithm tries to learn a vector in the
space of activation of the layers by training a linear classifier to differentiate between
activations generated by a concept's instances and instances present in any layer. So,
a <b> CAV </b> is defined as the normal projection to a hyperplane that separates instances
with a concept and instances without a concept in the model's activation. For our
zebra classifier, CAVs help to distinguish representations that denote black stripes
and representations that do not denote black stripes.

- <b> Estimating directional derivatives </b>: Directional derivatives are used to quantify
the sensitivity of a model prediction toward a concept. So, for our zebra classifier,
directional directives help us to measure the importance of the black stripes
representation in predicting zebras. Unlike saliency maps, which use per-pixel
saliency, directional derivatives are computed on the entire dataset or a set of inputs
but for a specific concept. This helps to give a global perspective for the explanation.

- <b> Estimating the TCAV score </b>: To quantify the concept importance of a particular
class, the TCAV score ( <b> TCAVq </b>) is calculated. This metric helps to measure the
positive or negative influence of a defined concept on a particular activation layer
of a model.

- <b> CAV validation </b>: CAV can be produced from randomly selected data. But
unfortunately, this might not produce meaningful concepts. So, in order to improve
the generated concepts, TCAV runs multiple iterations for finding concepts from
different batches of data, instead of training CAV once, on a single batch of data.
Then, a statistical significance test is performed using two-side t-test for selecting
the <b> statistically significant concepts </b>. Necessary corrections, such as the Bonferroni
correction, are also performed to control the false discovery rate.

Thus, we have covered the intuitive workings of the TCAV algorithm. Next, let's cover
how TCAV can actually be implemented in practice.

## II. Exploring the practical applications of TCAV

## III. Advantages and limitations

In the previous section, we covered the practical aspects of TCAV. TCAV is indeed a very
interesting and novel approach to explaining complex deep learning models. Although it
has many advantages, unfortunately, I did find some limitations in terms of the current
framework that can definitely be improved in the revised version.

### 1. Advantages
Let's discuss the following advantages first:

- As you have previously seen with the LIME framework , LIME for
Model Interpretability (which generates explanations using a global perturbation
method), there can be contradicting explanations for two data instances for the
same class. Even though TCAV is also a type of global perturbation method, unlike
LIME, TCAV-generated explanations are not only true for a single data instance but
also true for the entire class. This is a major advantage of TCAV over LIME, which
increases the user's trust in the explanation method.

- Concept-based explanations are closer to how humans would explain an unknown
observation, rather than feature-based explanations as adopted in LIME and SHAP.
So, TCAV-generated explanations are indeed more human-friendly.

- Feature-based explanations are limited to the features used in the model. To
introduce any new feature for model explainability, we would need to re-train the
model, whereas a concept-based explanation is more flexible and is not limited to
features used during model training. To introduce a new concept, we do not need
to retrain the model. Also, for introducing the concepts, you don't have to know
anything about ML. You would just have to make the necessary datasets to
generate concepts.

- Model explainability is not the only benefit of TCAV. TCAV can help to detect
issues during the training process, such as <b> imbalanced datasets </b> leading to <i> bias </i> in
 <i> the dataset vis-Ã -vis the majority class </i>. In fact, concept importance can be used as
a metric to compare models. For example, suppose you are using a VGG19 model
and a ResNet50 model. Let's say both these models have similar accuracy and model
performance, yet concept importance for a user-defined concept is much higher for
the VGG19 model as compared to the ResNet50 model. In such a case, it is better
to use the VGG19 model as compared to ResNet50. Hence, TCAV can be used to
improve the model training process.

These are some of the distinct advantages of TCAV, which makes it more human-friendly
than LIME and SHAP. Next, let's discuss some known limitations of TCAV.

### 2. Limitations

The following are some of the known disadvantages of the TCAV approach:

- Currently, the approach of concept-based explanation using TCAV is limited
to just neural networks. In order to increase its adoption, TCAV would need an
implementation that can work with classical machine learning algorithms such as
Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Ensemble Learning algorithms. Both
LIME and SHAP can be applied with classical ML algorithms to solve standard ML
problems and that is probably why LIME and SHAP have more adoption. Similarly,
with text data, too, TCAV has very limited applications.
TCAV is highly prone to data drift, adversarial effects, and other data quality issues
discussed in Chapter 3, Data-Centric Approaches. If you are using TCAV, you would
need to ensure that training data, inference data, and even concept data have similar
statistical properties. Otherwise, the concepts generated can become affected due to
noise or data impurity issues:

- Guillaume Alain and Yoshua Bengio, in their paper [Understanding intermediate layers using linear classifier probes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01644),
have expressed some concern about applying TCAV to shallower neural networks.
Many similar research papers have suggested that concepts in deeper layers are
more separable as compared to concepts in shallower networks and, hence, the use
of TCAV is limited to mostly deep neural networks.

- Preparing a concept dataset can be a challenging and expensive task. Although you
don't need ML knowledge to prepare a concept dataset, still, in practice, you do not
expect any common end user to spend time creating an annotated concept dataset
for any customized user-defined concept.

- I felt that the TCAV Python framework would require further improvements before
being used in any production-level system. In my opinion, at the time of writing
this chapter, this framework would need to mature further so that it can be used
easily with any production-level ML system.


I think all these limitations can indeed be solved to make TCAV a much more robust
framework that is widely adopted. If you are interested, you can also reach out to authors
and developers of the TCAV framework and contribute to the open source community! In
the next section, let's discuss some potential applications of concept-based explanations.

## IV. Potential applications of concept-based explanations

I do see great potential for concept-based explanations such as TCAV! In this section, you
will get exposure to some potential applications of concept-based explanations that can be
important research topics for the entire AI community, which are as follows:

- <b> Estimation of transparency and fairness in AI </b>: Most regulatory concerns for
black-box AI models are related to concepts such as gender, color, and race.
Concept-based explanations can actually help to estimate whether an AI algorithm
is fair in terms of these abstract concepts. The detection of bias for AI models can
actually improve its transparency and help to address certain regulatory concerns.
For example, in terms of doctors using deep learning models, TCAV can be used to
detect whether the model is biased toward a specific gender, color, or race as ideally,
these concepts are not important as regards the model's decision. High concept
importance for these concepts indicates the presence of bias. Figure below illustrates an
example where TCAV is used to detect model bias.

- <b> Detection of adversarial attacks with CAV </b>: If you go through the appendix of
the [TCAV research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11279.pdf),
the authors have mentioned that the concept importance of actual samples and
adversarial samples are quite different. This means that if an image gets impacted by
an adversarial attack, the concept importance would also change.

- <b> Concept-based image clustering </b>: Using CAVs to cluster images based on similar
concepts can be an interesting application. Deep learning-based image search
engines are a common application in which clustering or similarity algorithms are
applied to feature vectors to locate similar images. However, these are feature-based
methods. Similarly, there is a potential to apply concept-based image clustering
using CAVs.

- <b> Automated concept-based explanations (ACE) </b>: Ghorbani, Amirata, James Wexler,
James Zou, and Been Kim, in their research work â€“ Towards automatic conceptbased explanations, mentioned an automated version of TCAV that goes through
the training images and automatically discovers prominent concepts. This is an
interesting work, as I think it can have an important application in identifying
incorrectly labeled training data. In industrial applications, getting a perfectly
labeled curated dataset is extremely challenging. This problem can be solved to
a great extent using ACE.

- Concept-based Counterfactual Explanation: In previous, we discussed <b> counterfactual explanation (CFE) </b> as a mechanism for
generating actionable insights by suggesting changes to the input features that
can change the overall outcome. However, CFE is a feature-based explanation
method. It would be a really interesting topic of research to have a conceptbased counterfactual explanation, which is one step closer to human-friendly
explanations.

For example, if we say that it is going to rain today although there is a clear sky now,
we usually add a further explanation that suggests that the clear sky can be covered
with clouds, which increases the probability of rainfall. In other words, a clear sky is
a concept related to a sunny day, while a cloudy sky is a concept related to rainfall.
This example suggests that the forecast can be flipped if the concept describing the
situation is also flipped. Hence, this is the idea of the concept-based counterfactual.
The idea is not very far-fetched as <b> concept bottleneck models (CBMs) </b> presented
in the research work by [Koh et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04612),
can implement a similar idea of generated concept-based counterfactuals by
manipulating the neuron action of the bottleneck layer.

Figure below illustrates an example of using a concept-based counterfactual example. There is
no existing algorithm or framework that can help us achieve this, yet this can be a useful
application of concept-based approaches in computer vision.
