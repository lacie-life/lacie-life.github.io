[VoxelNet: End-to-End Learning for Point Cloud Based 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06396)

# 1. PointNet problem

<b> High computational and memory requiremente => Scaling up 3D feature learning networks to orders of magnitude more points and to 3D detection tasks. </b>

=> VoxelNet: a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network.

We
design a novel voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer, which
enables inter-point interaction within a voxel, by combining point-wise features with a locally aggregated feature.

Stacking multiple VFE layers allows learning complex features for characterizing local 3D shape information. 

Specifically, VoxelNet divides the point cloud into equally spaced
3D voxels, encodes each voxel via stacked VFE layers, and
then 3D convolution further aggregates local voxel features,
transforming the point cloud into a high-dimensional volumetric representation. 

Finally, a RPN consumes the volumetric representation and yields the detection result. This
efficient algorithm benefits both from the sparse point structure and efficient parallel processing on the voxel grid.

### 2.1.1. Feature Learning Network

- <b> Voxel Partition: </b> Given a point cloud, we subdivide the 3D space into equally spaced voxels as shown in Figure 2. Suppose the point cloud encompasses 3D space with range $D$,
$H$, $W$ along the $Z$, $Y$, $X$ axes respectively. We define each
voxel of size $v_D$, $v_H$, and $v_W$ accordingly. The resulting
3D voxel grid is of size $D' = D/v_D$, $H' = H/v_H$, $W' =
W/v_W$ . Here, for simplicity, we assume $D$, $H$, $W$ are a
multiple of $v_D$, $v_H$, $v_W$.

- <b> Grouping: </b> We group the points according to the voxel they
reside in. Due to factors such as distance, occlusion, object’s relative pose, and non-uniform sampling, the LiDAR point cloud is sparse and has highly variable point density
throughout the space. Therefore, after grouping, a voxel
will contain a variable number of points. An illustration is
shown in Figure 2, where Voxel-1 has significantly more
points than Voxel-2 and Voxel-4, while Voxel-3 contains no
point.

- <b> Random Sampling: </b> Typically a high-definition LiDAR
point cloud is composed of ∼100k points. Directly processing all the points not only imposes increased memory/efficiency burdens on the computing platform, but also
highly variable point density throughout the space might
bias the detection. To this end, we randomly sample a fixed
number, $T$, of points from those voxels containing more
than $T$ points. This sampling strategy has two purposes,
(1) computational savings; and
(2) decreases the imbalance of points between the voxels
which reduces the sampling bias, and adds more variation
to training.

- <b> Stacked Voxel Feature Encoding: </b> The key innovation is
the chain of VFE layers. For simplicity, Figure 2 illustrates
the hierarchical feature encoding process for one voxel.
Without loss of generality, we use VFE Layer-1 to describe
the details in the following paragraph. Figure 3 shows the
architecture for VFE Layer-1.

- <b> Sparse Tensor Representation: </b> By processing only the
non-empty voxels, we obtain a list of voxel features, each
uniquely associated to the spatial coordinates of a particular non-empty voxel. The obtained list of voxel-wise features can be represented as a sparse 4D tensor, of size
$C × D' × H' × W'$
as shown in Figure 2. Although the
point cloud contains ∼100k points, more than 90% of voxels typically are empty. Representing non-empty voxel features as a sparse tensor greatly reduces the memory usage
and computation cost during backpropagation, and it is a
critical step in our efficient implementation.

### 2.1.2. Convolutional Middle Layers

We use $ConvMD(c_{in}, c_{out}, k, s, p)$ to represent an Mdimensional convolution operator where $c_{in}$ and $c_{out}$ are
the number of input and output channels, $k$, $s$, and $p$ are the
M-dimensional vectors corresponding to kernel size, stride
size and padding size respectively. When the size across the
M-dimensions are the same, we use a scalar to represent
the size e.g. $k$ for $\textbf{k} = (k, k, k)$.

Each convolutional middle layer applies 3D convolution, BN layer, and ReLU layer sequentially. The convolutional
middle layers aggregate voxel-wise features within a progressively expanding receptive field, adding more context
to the shape description.

### 2.1.3. Region Proposal Network

The input to our RPN is the feature map provided by
the convolutional middle layers. The architecture of this
network is illustrated in Figure 4. The network has three
blocks of fully convolutional layers. The first layer of each
block downsamples the feature map by half via a convolution with a stride size of 2, followed by a sequence of convolutions of stride 1 (×q means q applications of the filter).
After each convolution layer, BN and ReLU operations are
applied. We then upsample the output of every block to a
fixed size and concatanate to construct the high resolution
feature map. Finally, this feature map is mapped to the desired learning targets: 

(1) a probability score map and 

(2) a regression map.

## 2.2. Loss Function

Let $\{a^{pos}_i\}_i = 1...N_{pos}$ be the set of Npos positive anchors and $\{a^{neg}_j\}_j=1...N_{neg}$ be the set of $N_{neg}$ negative
anchors. We parameterize a 3D ground truth box as $(x^g_c, y^g_c, z^g_c, l^g, w^g, h^g, θ^g)$, where $x^g_c$, $y^g_c$, $z^g_c$
represent the
center location, $l^g$, $w^g$, $h^g$
are length, width, height of the
box, and $θ^g$
is the yaw rotation around Z-axis. To retrieve the ground truth box from a matching positive anchor
parameterized as $(x^a_c, y^a_c, z^a_c, l^a, w^a, h^a, θ^a)$, we define the
residual vector $u∗ ∈ R^7$
containing the 7 regression targets corresponding to center location $∆x$, $∆y$, $∆z$, three dimensions $∆l$, $∆w$, $∆h$, and the rotation $∆θ$, which are computed as:

![img](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/paper-note-4-4.png?raw=true)

where $d^a =\sqrt{(l^a)^2 + (w^a)^2}$ is the diagonal of the base
of the anchor box. Here, we aim to directly estimate the
oriented 3D box and normalize $∆x$ and $∆y$ homogeneously
with the diagonal $d$
a. We define the loss function as follows:

![img](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/paper-note-4-5.png?raw=true)


where $p^{pos}_i$ and $p^{neg}_j$
represent the softmax output for positive anchor $a^{pos}_i$
and negative anchor $a^{neg}_j$
respectively, while $u_i ∈ R^7$
and $u^∗_i ∈ R^7$
are the regression output and
ground truth for positive anchor aposi
. The first two terms are
the normalized classification loss for $\{a^{pos}_i\}_i=1...N_{pos}$ and $\{a^{neg}_j\}_j=1...N_{neg}$ , where the $L_{cls}$ stands for binary cross entropy loss and $α$, $β$ are postive constants balancing the relative importance. The last term $L_{reg}$ is the regression loss,
where we use the SmoothL1 function.

## 2.3. Efficient Implementation

GPUs are optimized for processing dense tensor structures. The problem with working directly with the point
cloud is that the points are sparsely distributed across space
and each voxel has a variable number of points. We devised
a method that converts the point cloud into a dense tensor
structure where stacked VFE operations can be processed
in parallel across points and voxels.

The method is summarized in Figure 5. We initialize a
$K × T × 7$ dimensional tensor structure to store the voxel
input feature buffer where $K$ is the maximum number of
non-empty voxels, $T$ is the maximum number of points
per voxel, and 7 is the input encoding dimension for each
point. The points are randomized before processing. For
each point in the point cloud, we check if the corresponding
voxel already exists. This lookup operation is done efficiently in $O(1)$ using a hash table where the voxel coordinate is used as the hash key. If the voxel is already initialized we insert the point to the voxel location if there are less
than $T$ points, otherwise the point is ignored. If the voxel
is not initialized, we initialize a new voxel, store its coordinate in the voxel coordinate buffer, and insert the point to
this voxel location. The voxel input feature and coordinate
buffers can be constructed via a single pass over the point
list, therefore its complexity is $O(n)$. To further improve
the memory/compute efficiency it is possible to only store
a limited number of voxels $(K)$ and ignore points coming
from voxels with few points.

After the voxel input buffer is constructed, the stacked
VFE only involves point level and voxel level dense operations which can be computed on a GPU in parallel. Note
that, after concatenation operations in VFE, we reset the
features corresponding to empty points to zero such that
they do not affect the computed voxel features. Finally,
using the stored coordinate buffer we reorganize the computed sparse voxel-wise structures to the dense voxel grid.
The following convolutional middle layers and RPN operations work on a dense voxel grid which can be efficiently
implemented on a GPU.
