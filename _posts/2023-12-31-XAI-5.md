# [XAI 5] - Model Interpretability Using SHAP

<b> SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) </b> is another popular choice of explainability
technique in ML and, in certain scenarios, is more effective than LIME.

## I. An intuitive understanding of the SHAP and Shapley values

### 1. Introduction to SHAP and Shapley values

The SHAP framework was introduced by Scott Lundberg and Su-In Lee in their research
work, [A Unified Approach of Interpreting Model Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874). This was published in 2017. SHAP is based on the concept of
Shapley values from cooperative game theory, but unlike the LIME framework, it
considers additive feature importance. By definition, the Shapley value is the mean
marginal contribution of each feature value across all possible values in the feature space.
The mathematical understanding of Shapley values is complicated and might confuse
most readers. That said, if you are interested in getting an in-depth mathematical
understanding of Shapley values, we recommend that you take a look at the research
paper called "A Value for n-Person Games." Contributions to the Theory of Games 2.28
(1953), by Lloyd S. Shapley. In the next section, we will gain an intuitive understanding
of Shapley values with a very simple example.

### 2. What are Shapley values?

In this section, I will explain Shapley values using a very simple and easy-to-understand
example. Let's suppose that Alice, Bob, and Charlie are three friends who are taking part,
as a team, in a Kaggle competition to solve a given problem with ML, for a certain cash
prize. Their collective goal is to win the competition and get the prize money. All three of
them are equally not good in all areas of ML and, therefore, have contributed in different
ways. Now, if they win the competition and earn their prize money, how will they ensure a
fair distribution of the prize money considering their individual contributions? How will they
measure their individual contributions for the same goal? The answer to these questions can
be given by Shapley values, which were introduced in 1951 by Lloyd Shapley.

The following diagram gives us a visual illustration of the scenario:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-42.png?raw=true)

So, in this scenario, Alice, Bob, and Charlie are part of the same team, playing the same
game (which is the Kaggle competition). In game theory, this is referred to as a <b> Coalition
Game </b>. The prize money for the competition is their <i> payout </i>. So, Shapley values tell us the
average contribution of each player to the payout ensuring a fair distribution. But <i> why not
just equally distribute the prize money between all the players? </i> Well, since the contributions
are not equal, it is not fair to distribute the money equally.

#### a. Deciding the payouts

Now, how do we decide the fairest way to distribute the payout? One way is to assume
that Alice, Bob, and Charlie joined the game in a sequence in which Alice started first,
followed by Bob, and then followed by Charlie. Let's suppose that if Alice, Bob, and
Charlie had participated alone, they would have gained 10 points, 20 points, and 25
points, respectively. But if only Alice and Bob teamed up, they might have received
40 points. While Alice and Charlie together could get 30 points, Bob and Charlie
together could get 50 points. When all three of them collaborate together, only then
do they get 90 points, which is sufficient for them to win the competition.

Figure below illustrates the point values for each condition. We will make use of these values
to calculate the average marginal contribution of each player:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-43.png?raw=true)

Mathematically, if we assume that there are N players, where $S$ is the coalition subset of
players and $𝑣(𝑆)$ is the total value of $S$ players, then by the formula of Shapley values, the
marginal contribution of player i is given as follows:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-44.png?raw=true)

The equation of Shapley value might look complicated, but let's simplify this with our
example. Please note that the order in which each player starts the game is important
to consider as Shapley values try to account for the order of each player to calculate the
marginal contribution.

Now, for our example, the contribution of Alice can be calculated by calculating the
difference that Alice can cause to the final score. So, the contribution is calculated by
taking the difference in the points scored when Alice is in the game and when she is not.
Also, when Alice is playing, she can either play alone or team up with others. When Alice
is playing, the value that she can create can be represented as $𝑣(𝐴)$. Likewise, $𝑣(𝐵)$ and
$𝑣(𝐶)$ denote individual values created by Bob and Charlie. Now, when Alice and Bob are
teaming up, we can calculate only Alice's contribution by removing Bob's contribution
from the overall contribution. This can be represented as $𝑣(𝐴, 𝐵)– 𝑣(𝐵)$. And if all three are
playing together, Alice's contribution is given as $𝑣(𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶)– 𝑣(𝐵, 𝐶)$.

Considering all possible permutations of the sequences by which Alice, Bob, and Charlie
play the game, the marginal contribution of Alice is the average of her individual
contributions in all possible scenarios. This is illustrated in Figure below:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-45.png?raw=true)

So, the overall contribution of Alice will be her marginal contribution across all possible
scenarios, which also happens to be the Shapley value. For Alice, the Shapley value is
20.83. Similarly, we can calculate the marginal contribution for Bob and Charlie, as shown
in Figure below:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-46.png?raw=true)

I hope this wasn't too difficult to understand! One thing to note is that the sum of
marginal contributions of Alice, Bob, and Charlie should be equal to the total contribution
made by all three of them together. Now, let's try to understand Shapley values in the
context of ML.

### 3. Shapley values in ML

In order to understand the importance of Shapley values in ML to explain model
predictions, we will try to modify the example about Alice, Bob, and Charlie that we used
for understanding Shapley values. We can consider Alice, Bob, and Charlie to be <i> three
different features present in a dataset used for training a model </i>. So, in this case, the <i> player
contributions </i> will be the contribution of each feature. The game or the Kaggle competition
will be the black-box ML model and the payout will be the prediction. So, if we want to know
the contribution of each feature toward the model prediction, we will use Shapley values.

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-47.png?raw=true)

Therefore, Shapley values help us to understand the collective contribution of each feature
toward the outcome predicted by black-box ML models. By using Shapley values, we can
explain the working of black-box models by estimating the feature contributions.

#### Properties of Shapley values

Now that we have an intuitive understanding of Shapley values and we have learned how
to calculate Shapley values, we should also gain an understanding of the properties of
Shapley values:

- <b> Efficiency </b>: The total sum of Shapley values or the marginal contribution of
each feature should be equal to the value of the total coalition. 

- <b> Symmetry </b>: Each player has a fair chance of joining the game in any order. 

- <b> Dummy </b>: If a particular feature does not change the predicted value regardless of
the coalition group, then the Shapley value for the feature is 0.

- <b> Additivity </b>: For any game with a combined payout, the Shapley values
are also combined. This is denoted as $𝜑(𝑣 + 𝑤) = 𝜑(𝑣) + 𝜑(𝑤)$, then
$(𝑣 + 𝑤)(𝑆) = 𝑣(𝑆) + 𝑤(𝑆)$. For example, for the random forest algorithm in ML,
Shapley values can be calculated for a particular feature by calculating it for each
individual tree and then averaging them to find the additive Shapley value for the
entire random forest.

So, these are the important properties of Shapley values. Next, let's discuss the SHAP
framework and understand how it is much more than just the usage of Shapley values.

### 4. The SHAP framework

Previously, we discussed what Shapley values are and how they are used in ML. Now,
let's cover the SHAP framework. Although SHAP is popularly used as an XAI tool
for providing local explainability to individual predictions, SHAP can also provide a
global explanation by aggregating the individual predictions. Additionally, SHAP is
model-agnostic, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the algorithm
used in black-box models. The creators of the framework broadly came up with two
model-agnostic approximation methods, which are as follows:

- <b> SHAP Explainer </b>: This is based on Shapley sampling values.
- <b> KernelSHAP Explainer </b>: This is based on the LIME approach.

The framework also includes model-specific explainability methods such as the following:

- <b> Linear SHAP </b>: This is for linear models with independent features.
- <b> Tree SHAP </b>: This is an algorithm that is faster than SHAP explainers to compute
SHAP values for tree algorithms and tree-based ensemble learning algorithms.
- <b> Deep SHAP </b>: This is an algorithm that is faster than SHAP explainers to compute
SHAP values for deep learning models.

Apart from these approaches, SHAP also uses interesting visualization methods to explain
AI models. We will cover these methods in more detail in the next section. But one point
to note is that the calculation of Shapley values is computationally very expensive, and
the algorithm is of the order of $𝑂(2^𝑛)$, where n is the number of features. So, if the dataset
has many features, calculating Shapley values might take forever! However, the SHAP
framework uses an approximation technique to calculate Shapley values efficiently. The
explanation provided by SHAP is more robust as compared to the LIME framework.
Let's proceed to the next section, where we will discuss the various model explainability
approaches used by SHAP on various types of data.

## II. Model explainability approaches using SHAP

After reading the previous section, you have gained an understanding of SHAP and
Shapley values. In this section, we will discuss various model-explainability approaches
using SHAP. Data visualization is an important method to explain the working of complex
algorithms. SHAP makes use of various interesting data visualization techniques to
represent the approximated Shapley values to explain black-box models. So, let's discuss
some of the popular visualization methods used by the SHAP framework.

### 1. Visualizations in SHAP

As mentioned previously, SHAP can be used for both the global interpretability of the
model and the local interpretability of the inference data instance. Now, the values
generated by the SHAP algorithm are quite difficult to understand unless we make use
of intuitive visualizations. The choice of visualization depends on the choice of global
interpretability or local interpretability, which we will cover in this section.

#### a. Global interpretability with feature importance bar plots

Analyzing the most influential features present in a dataset always helps us to understand
the functioning of an algorithm with respect to the underlying data. SHAP provides
an effective way in which to find feature importance using Shapley values. So, the
feature importance bar plot displays the important features in descending order of their
importance. Additionally, SHAP provides a unique way to show feature interactions
using [hierarchical clustering](https://www.displayr.com/what-ishierarchical-clustering/). These feature clustering methods help us to visualize
a group of features that collectively impacts the model's outcome. This is very interesting
since one of the core benefits of using Shapley values is to analyze the additive influence of
multiple features together. However, there is one drawback of the feature importance plot
for global interpretability. Since this method only considers mean absolute Shapley values
to estimate feature importance, it doesn't show whether collectively certain features are
impacting the model in a negative way or not.

The following diagram illustrates the visualizations for a feature importance plot and
a feature clustering plot using SHAP:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-48.png?raw=true)

Next, let's explore SHAP Cohort plots.

#### b. Global interpretability with the Cohort plot

Sometimes, analyzing subgroups of data is an important part of data analysis. SHAP
provides a very interesting way of grouping the data into certain defined cohorts to
analyze feature importance. I found this to be a unique option in SHAP, which can be
really helpful! This is an extension of the existing feature importance visualization, and it
highlights feature importance for each of the cohorts for a better comparison.

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-49.png?raw=true)

#### c. Global interpretability with heatmap plots

To understand the overall impact of all features on the model at a more granular level,
heatmap visualizations are extremely useful. The SHAP heatmap visualization shows
how every feature value can positively or negatively impact the outcome. Additionally,
the plot also includes a line plot to show how the model prediction varies with the
positive or negative impact of feature values. However, for non-technical users, this
visualization can be really challenging to interpret. This is one of the drawbacks of this
visualization method.

Figure below illustrates a SHAP heatmap visualization:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-50.png?raw=true)

Another popular choice of visualization for global interpretability using SHAP is
summary plots. Let's discuss summary plots in the next section.

#### d. Global interpretability with summary plots

A summary plot is another visualization method in SHAP for providing global
explainability of black-box models. It is a good replacement for the feature importance
plot, which not only includes the important features but also the range of effects of
these features present in the dataset. The color bar indicates the impact of the features.
The features that influence the model's outcome in a positive way are highlighted in
a particular color, whereas the features that impact the model's outcome negatively are
represented in another contrasting color. The horizontal violin plot for each feature
shows the distribution of the Shapley values of the features for each data instance.

The following screenshot illustrates a SHAP summary plot:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-51.png?raw=true)

In the next section, we will discuss SHAP dependence plots.

#### e. Global interpretability with dependence plots

In certain scenarios, it is important to analyze interactions between the features and how
this interaction influences the model outcome. So, SHAP feature dependence plots show
the variation of the model outcome by specific features. This plot can help to pick up interesting interaction patterns or trends between the feature
values. The features used for selecting the color map are automatically picked up by the
algorithm, based on the interaction with a specific selected feature.

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-52.png?raw=true)

In this example, the selected feature is pH, and the feature used for selecting the colormap
is alcohol. So, the plot tells us that with an increase in pH, the alcohol value also increases.
This will be covered in greater detail in the next section.
In the next section, let's explore the SHAP visualization methods used for local
explainability

#### f. Local interpretability with bar plots

So far, we have covered various visualization techniques offered by SHAP for providing
a global overview of the model. However, similar to LIME, SHAP is also model-agnostic
that is designed to provide local explainability. SHAP provides certain visualization
methods that can be applied to inference data for local explainability. Local feature
importance using SHAP bar plots is one such local explainability method. This plot can
help us analyze the positive and negative impact of the features that are present in the
data. The features that impact the model's outcome positively are highlighted in one
color (pinkish-red by default), and the features having a negative impact on the model
outcome are represented using another color (blue by default). Also, as we have discussed
before, if the Shapley value is zero for any feature, this indicates that the feature does not
influence the model outcome at all. Additionally, the bar plot centers at zero to show the
contribution of the features present in the data.

The following diagram shows a SHAP feature importance bar plot for local interpretability:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-53.png?raw=true)

Next, let's cover another SHAP visualization that is used for local interpretability.

#### g. Local interpretability with waterfall plots

Bar charts are not the only visualization provided by SHAP for local interpretability.
The same information can be displayed using a waterfall plot, which might look more
attractive. Perhaps, the only difference is that waterfall plots are not centered at zero,
whereas bar plots are centered at zero. Otherwise, we get the same feature importance
based on Shapley values and the positive or the negative impact of the specific features on
the model outcome.

Figure below illustrates a SHAP waterfall plot for local interpretability:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-54.png?raw=true)

Next, we will discuss force plot visualization in SHAP.

#### h. Local interpretability with force plot

We can also use force plots instead of waterfall or bar plots to explain local inference data.
With force plots, we can see the model prediction, which is denoted by f(x). The base value in the following diagram represents the average predicted
outcome of the model. The base value is actually used when the features present in the
local data instance are not considered. So, using the force plot, we can also see how
far the predicted outcome is from the base value. Additionally, we can see the feature
impacts as the visual highlights certain features that try to increase the model prediction
 along with other important features that
have a negative influence on the model as it tries to lower the prediction value.

So, Figure below illustrates a sample force plot visualization in SHAP:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-55.png?raw=true)

Although force plots might visually look very interesting, we would recommend using bar
plots or waterfall plots if the dataset contains many features affecting the model outcome
in a positive or a negative way.

#### i. Local interpretability with decision plots

The easiest way to explain something is by comparing it with a reference value. So far, in
bar plots, waterfall plots, and even force plots, we do not see any reference values for the
underlying features used. However, in order to find out whether the feature values are
positively or negatively influencing the model outcome, the algorithm is actually trying
to compare the feature values of the inference data with the mean of the feature values of
the trained model. So, this is the reference value that is not displayed in the three local
explainability visualization plots that we covered. But SHAP decision plots help us to
compare the feature values of the local data instance with the mean feature values of the
training dataset. Additionally, decision plots show the deviation of the feature values, the
model prediction, and the direction of deviation of features from the reference values. If
the direction of deviation is toward the right, this indicates that the feature is positively
influencing the model outcome; if the direction of deviation is toward the left, this
represents the negative influence of the feature on the model outcome. Different colors are
used to highlight positive or negative influences. If there is no deviation, then the features
are actually not influencing the model outcome.

The following diagram illustrates the use of decision plots to compare two different data
instances for providing local explainability:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-56.png?raw=true)

So far, you have seen the variety of visualization methods provided in SHAP for the
global and local explainability of ML models. Now, let's discuss the various types of
explainers in SHAP.

### 2. Explainers in SHAP

In the previous section, we looked at how the data visualization techniques that are
available in SHAP can be used to provide explainability. But the choice of the visualization
method might also depend on the choice of the explainer algorithm. As we discussed
earlier, SHAP provides both model-specific and model-agnostic explainability. But the
framework has multiple explainer algorithms that can be applied with different models
and with different types of datasets. In this section, we will cover the various explainer
algorithms provided in SHAP.

#### a. TreeExplainer

TreeExplainer is a fast implementation of the [Tree SHAP algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03888.pdf) for computing Shapley values for trees and tree-based
ensemble learning algorithms. The algorithm makes many diverse possible assumptions
about the feature dependence of the features present in the dataset. Only tree-based
algorithms are supported such as Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. The
algorithm relies on fast C++ implementations in either the local compiled C extension or
inside an external model package, but it is faster than conventional Shapley value-based
explainers. Generally, it is used for tree-based models trained on structured data for both
classification and regression problems

#### b. DeepExplainer

Similar to LIME, SHAP can also be applied to deep learning models trained on
unstructured data, such as images and texts. SHAP uses DeepExplainer, which is based
on the <b> Deep SHAP algorithm </b> for explaining deep learning models. The <b> DeepExplainer
algorithm </b> is designed for deep learning models to approximate SHAP values. The
algorithm is a modified version of the [DeepLIFT algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02685). The developers of the framework have mentioned that the
implementation of the Deep SHAP algorithm differs slightly from the original DeepLIFT
algorithm. It uses a distribution of background samples rather than a single reference
value. Additionally, the Deep SHAP algorithm also uses Shapley equations to linearize
computations such as products, division, max, softmax, and more. The framework mostly
supports deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

#### c. GradientExplainer

DeepExplainer is not the only explainer in SHAP that can be used with deep learning
models. GradientExplainer can also work with deep learning models. The algorithm
explains models using the concept of <b> expected gradients </b>. The expected gradient is an
extension of [Integrated Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365),
SHAP, and [SmoothGrad](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03825), which
combines the ideas of these algorithms into a single expected value equation.
Consequently, similar to DeepExplainer, the entire dataset can be used as the background
distribution sample instead of a single reference sample. This allows the model to be
approximated with a linear function between individual samples of the data and the
current input data instance that is to be explained. Since the input features are assumed to
be independent, the expected gradients will calculate the approximate SHAP values.

For model explainability, the feature values with higher SHAP values are highlighted,
as these features have a positive contribution toward the model's outcome. For
unstructured data such as images, pixel positions that have the maximum contribution
toward the model prediction are highlighted. Usually, GradientExplainer is slower than
DeepExplainer as it makes different approximation assumptions.

The following diagram shows a sample GradientExplainer visualization for the local
explainability of a classification model trained on images:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-57.png?raw=true)

Next, let's discuss SHAP KernelExplainers.

#### d. KernelExplainer

KernelExplainers in SHAP use the <b> Kernel SHAP </b> method to provide model-agnostic
explainability. To estimate the SHAP values for any model, the Kernel SHAP algorithm
utilizes a specifically weighted local linear regression approach to compute feature
importance. The major difference between Kernel
SHAP and LIME is the approach that is adopted to assign weights to the instances in
a regression model. In LIME, the weights are assigned based on how close the local data instances are to
the original instance. Whereas in Kernel SHAP, the weights are assigned based on the
estimated Shapley values of the coalition of features used. In simple words, LIME assigns
weights based on isolated features, whereas SHAP considers the combined effect of
the features for assigning the weights. KernelExplainer is slower than model-specific
algorithms as it does not make any assumptions about the model type.

#### e. LinearExplainer

SHAP LinearExplainer is designed for computing SHAP values for linear models to
analyze inter-feature correlations. LinearExplainer also supports the estimation of the
feature covariance matrix for coalition feature importance. However, finding feature
correlations for a high-dimensional dataset can be computationally expensive. But
LinearExplainers are fast and efficient as they use sampling to estimate a transformation.
This is then used for explaining any outcome of linear models.

Therefore, we have discussed the theoretical aspect of various explainers in SHAP. For
more information about these explainers, I do recommend [checking out](https://shap-lrjball.readthedocs.io/en/docs_update/api.html). In the next
chapter, we will cover the practical implementation of the SHAP explainers using the
code tutorials on GitHub in which we will implement the SHAP explainers for explaining
models trained on different types of datasets. In the next section, we will cover a practical
tutorial on how to use SHAP for explaining regression models to give you a glimpse of
how to apply SHAP for model explainability.

## III. Using SHAP to explain regression models



## V. Advantages and limitations of SHAP

In the previous section, we discussed the practical application of SHAP for explaining
a regression model with just a few lines of code. However, since SHAP is not the only
explainability framework, we should be aware of the specific advantages and disadvantages
of SHAP, too.

### 1. Advantages

The following is a list of some of the advantages of SHAP:

- <b> Local explainability </b>: Since SHAP provides local explainability to inference data,
it enables users to analyze key factors that are positively or negatively affecting the
model's decision-making process. As SHAP provides local explainability, it is useful
for production-level ML systems, too.

- <b> Global explainability </b>: Global explainability provided in SHAP helps to extract key
information about the model and the training data, especially from the collective
feature importance plots. I think SHAP is better than LIME for getting a global
perspective on the model. SP-LIME in LIME is good for getting an example-driven
global perspective of the model, but I think SHAP provides a generalized global
understanding of trained models.

- <b> Model-agnostic and model-specific </b>: SHAP can be model-agnostic and modelspecific. So, it can work with black-box models and also work with complex deep
learning models to provide explainability.

- <b> Theoretical robustness </b>: The concept of using Shapley values for model
explainability, which is based on the principles of coalition game theory, captures
feature interaction very well. Also, the properties of SHAP regarding <i> efficiency,
symmetry, dummy </i>, and <i> additivity </i> are formulated on a robust theoretical foundation.
Unlike SHAP, LIME is not based on a solid theory as it assumes ML models will
behave linearly for some local data points. But there is not much theoretical
evidence that proves why this assumption is true for all cases. That is why I would
say SHAP is based on ideas that are theoretically more robust than LIME.

These advantages make SHAP one of the most popular choices of the XAI framework.
Unfortunately, applying SHAP can be really challenging for high-dimensional datasets as
it does not provide actionable explanations. Let's look at some of the limitations of SHAP.

### 2. Limitations

Here is a list of some of the limitations of SHAP:

- <b> SHAP is not the preferred choice for high-dimensional data </b>: Computing Shapley
values on high-dimensional data can be computationally more challenging, as the
time complexity of the algorithm is 𝑂𝑂(2𝑛𝑛), where n is the total number of features in
the dataset.

- <b> Shapley values are ineffective for selective explanation </b>: Shapley values try to
consider all the features for providing explainability. The explanations can be
incorrect for sparse explanations, in which only selected features are considered.
But usually, human-friendly explanations consider selective features. So, I would
say that LIME is better than SHAP when you seek a selective explanation. However,
more recent versions of the SHAP framework do include the same ideas as LIME
and can be almost equally effective for sparse explanations.

- <b> SHAP cannot be used for prescriptive insights </b>: SHAP computes the Shapley
values for each feature and does not build a prediction model like LIME. So, it
cannot be used for analyzing any what-if scenario or for providing any counterfactual example for suggesting actionable insights.

- <b> KernelSHAP can be slow </b>: Although KernelSHAP is model-agnostic, it can be very
slow and, thus, might not be suitable for production-level ML systems for models
trained on high-dimensional data.

- <b> Not extremely human-friendly </b>: Apart from analyzing feature importance through
feature interactions, SHAP visualizations can be complicated to interpret for any
non-technical user. Often, non-technical users prefer simple selective actionable
insights, recommendations, or justifications from ML models. Unfortunately, SHAP
requires another layer of abstraction for human-friendly explanations when used in
production systems.

As we can see from the points discussed in this section, SHAP might not be the most
ideal framework for explainability, and there is a lot of space for improvement to make it
more human-friendly. However, it is indeed an important and very useful framework for
explaining black-box algorithms, especially for technical users. This brings us to the end
of the part.
