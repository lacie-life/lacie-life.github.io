### Basic Linux Command

1. ls - List Directories Content (in windows we call these as a folders)

2. cd - Changes the current directories

3. pwd - Displays the present working directory

4. cat - Concatenates and display files

5. echo - Display Arguments to the Screen

6. man - Display the Manual (and this can be used with specific commands to show the manual for them)

7. exit - Exit the shell or your current Session

8. which - locate a command by searching the directories specified by the environmental variable PATH (see Below)

9. clear - Clears the Screen

#### Note: What are Environment Variables and what is $PATH?

environment variables are a set of dynamic named values, stored within the system that are used by applications launched in shells.
there are systemwide and User-Defined Variables.
example on the systemwide Variables is $PATH where $PATH is an environment variable specifying where executable programs are located.
