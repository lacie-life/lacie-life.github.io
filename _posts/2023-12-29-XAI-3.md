# [XAI 3] - Data-Centric Approaches

In the previous part, we discussed various model explainability methods. Most of the
methods discussed in Model Explainability Methods, are model-centric. The
concepts and ideas discussed were focused on making black-box models interpretable. But
recently, the ML and AI communities have realized the core importance of data for any
analysis or modeling purposes. So, more and more AI researchers are exploring new ideas
and concepts around data-centric AI.

Since data plays a vital role in the model-building and prediction process, it is even more
important for us to explain the functioning of any ML and AI algorithm with respect to
the underlying data. From what I have observed from my experience in this field, the
failure of any ML systems in production happens neither due to the poor choice of ML
algorithm nor due to an inefficient model training or tuning process, but rather it occurs
mostly due to inconsistencies in the underlying dataset. So, this part focuses on the
concepts of data-centric explainable AI (XAI).

## I. Introduction to data-centric XAI

<i> Andrew Ng </i>, one of the influential thought leaders in the field of AI and ML, has often
highlighted the importance of using a systematic approach to build AI systems with
high-quality data. He is one of the pioneers of the idea of <b> data-centric AI </b>, which focuses
on developing systematic processes to develop models using clean, consistent, and
reliable data, instead of focusing on the code and the algorithm. If the data is consistent,
unambiguous, balanced, and available in sufficient quantity, this leads to faster model
building, improved accuracy, and faster deployment for any production-level system.

Unfortunately, all AI and ML systems that exist in production today are not in alignment
with the principles of <b> data-centric AI </b>. Consequently, there can be severe issues with the
underlying data that seldom get detected but eventually lead to the failure of ML systems.
That is why data-centric XAI is important to inspect and evaluate the quality of the data
being used.

When we talk about explaining the functioning of any black-box model with respect to
the data, we should inspect the <i> volume of the data </i>, the <i> consistency of the data </i> (particularly
for supervised ML problems), and the <i> purity and integrity of the data </i>. Now, let's discuss
these important aspects of data-centric XAI and understand why they are important.

### 1. Analyzing data volume

One of the classical problems of ML algorithms is the lack of generalization due to
<b> overfitting </b>. Overfitting can be reduced by adding more data or by getting datasets of the
appropriate volume to solve the underlying problem. So, the very first question we should
ask about the data to explain the black-box model is <i> "Is the model trained on sufficient
data?" </i> But for any industrial application, since data is very expensive, adding more data
is not always feasible. So, the question should be <i> "How do we find out if the model was
trained on sufficient data?" </i>

One way to inspect whether the model was trained on sufficient data is by training
models with 70%, 80%, and 90% of the training dataset. If the model accuracy shows an
increasing trend, with an increase in the volume of the data, that means the volume of the
data can influence the model's performance. If the accuracy of the trained model, which
has been trained on the entire training dataset, is low, then an increasing trend of model
accuracy with increasing data volume indicates that the model is not trained on sufficient
data. Therefore, more data is needed to make the model more accurate and generalized.

For production systems, if data is continuously flowing and there is no constraint on
the availability of data, continuous training and monitoring of the models should be done
on changing volumes of the data to understand and analyze its impact on the overall
model performance.

### 2. Analyzing data consistency

Data consistency is another important factor to inspect when explaining ML models
with respect to the data. One of the fundamental steps of analyzing data consistency is by
understanding the distribution of the data. If the <i> data is not evenly distributed </i>, if there is
a <i> class imbalance </i>, or if the <i> data is skewed toward a particular direction </i>, it is very likely that
the model will be <i> biased </i> or less efficient for a particular segment of the data.

For production systems, it has been often observed that the inference data used in the
production application might have some variance with the data used during training
and validation. This phenomenon is known as <b> data drift </b>, and it refers to an unexpected
change in the data structure or the statistical properties of the dataset, thus making the
data corrupt and hampering the functioning of the ML system.

Data drift is very common for most real-time predictive models. This is simply because, in
most situations, the data distribution changes over a period of time. This can happen due
to a variety of reasons, for instance, if the system through which the data is being collected
(for example, sensors) starts malfunctioning or needs to be recalibrated, then data drift
can occur. Other external factors such as the surrounding temperature and surrounding
noise can also introduce data drift. There can be a natural change in the relationship
between the features that might cause data to drift. Consequently, if the training data
is significantly different from the inference data, the model will make an error when
predicting the outcome.

Now, sometimes, there can be a drift in the whole dataset or there can be a drift in one or
more features. If there is a drift in a single feature, this is referred to as feature drift. There
are multiple ways to detect feature drift such as the [Population Stability Index (PSI)](https://www.lexjansen.com/wuss/2017/47_Final_Paper_PDF.pdf),
[Kullbackâ€“Leibler Divergence (KL Divergence)](https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2017/5/9/kullback-leibler-divergence-explained), and
[Wasserstein metric (Earth Movers Distance)](http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/99/1620/CS-TR-99-1620.ch4.pdf).

The
application of some of these techniques has been demonstrated at [this notebook](https://github.com/lacie-life/BlogSharingCode/blob/main/XAI-Books/Data_Centric_XAI_part_1.ipynb). These statistical methods are popular ways
to measure the distance between two data distributions. So, if the distance is significantly
large, this is an indication of the presence of drift.

Apart from feature drift, Label Drift or Concept Drift can occur if the statistical
properties of the target variable change over a period of time due to unknown reasons.
However, overall data consistency is an important parameter for <i> root cause analysis
inspection </i> when interpreting black-box models.

### 3. Analyzing data purity

The datasets used for practical industrial problems are never clean, even though most
organizations spend a significant amount of time and investment on data engineering and
data curation to drive a culture of <i> data-driven decision-making </is>. Yet, almost all practical
datasets are messy and require a systematic approach to curation and preparation.

When we train a model, usually, we put our efforts into data preprocessing and
preparation steps such as <i> finding duplicates or unique values, removing noise or unwanted
values from the data, detecting outliers, handling missing values, handling features with
mixed data types </i>, and even <i> transforming raw features or feature engineering </i> to get better
ML models. On a high level, these methods are meant for removing impurities from the
training data. But what if <i> a black-box ML model is trained on a dataset with less purity and,
hence, performs poorly?</i>

That is why analyzing data purity is an important step in data-centric XAI. Aside from
the data preprocessing and preparation methods mentioned earlier, there are other data
integrity issues that exist as follows:

- <b> Label ambiguity </b>: For supervised ML problems, <b> label ambiguity </b> can be a very
critical problem. If two or more instances of a dataset, which are very similar, have
multiple labels, then this can lead to label ambiguity. Ambiguous labeling of the
target variable can increase the difficulty of even domain experts classifying the
samples correctly. Label ambiguity can be a very common problem, as, usually,
labeled datasets are prepared by human subject-matter experts who are prone to
 <i> human error </i>.

- <b> Dominating features frequency change (DFCC) </b>: Inspecting DFFC in the training
and inference dataset is another parameter that can cause data integrity issues. In
[XAI 2] Model Explainability Methods, when we discussed feature importance, we
understood that not all features within the dataset are equally important, and some
of the features have more influential power on the model's decision-making process.
These are the dominating features in the dataset, and if the variance in the values of
the dominating features in the training and the inference dataset is high, it is very
likely that the model will make errors when predicting the outcome.

Other data purity issues, such as the introduction of a new label or new feature category,
or out of bound values (or anomalies) for a particular feature in the inference set, can
cause the failure of ML systems in production.

The following table shows certain important data purity checks that can be performed
using the <b> Deepchecks Python framework </b>:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-30.png?raw=true)

Data-centric XAI also includes other parameters that can be analyzed such as [Adversarial robustness](https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org/introduction/), the
[trust score comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11783), [covariate shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08234), [data leakage between the training and validation datasets](https://machinelearningmastery.com/data-leakage-machine-learning/), and <i> model performance sensitivity analysis </i> based on data
alterations. All of these concepts apply to both tabular data and unstructured data such
as images and text.

To explore practical ways of data purity analysis, you can refer to [this notebook](https://github.com/lacie-life/BlogSharingCode/blob/main/XAI-Books/Data_Centric_XAI_part_1.ipynb).

## II. Thorough data analysis and profiling process

In the previous section, you were introduced to the concept of data-centric XAI in which
we discussed three important aspects of data-centric XAI: analyzing data volume, data
consistency, and data purity. You might already be aware of some of the methods of data
analysis and data profiling that we are going to learn in this section. But we are going
to assume that we already have a trained ML model and, now, we are working toward
explaining the model's decision-making process by adopting data-centric approaches.

### 1. The need for data analysis and profiling processes

In [XAI 2] Model Explainability Methods, when we discussed knowledge extraction
using exploratory data analysis (EDA), we discovered that this was a pre-hoc analysis
process, in which we try to understand the data to form relevant hypotheses. As data
scientists, these initial hypotheses are important as they allow us to take the necessary
steps to build a better model. But let's suppose that we have a baseline trained ML model
and the model is not performing as expected because it is not meeting the benchmark
accuracy scores that were set.

Following the principles of model-centric approaches, most data scientists might want
to spend more time in hyperparameter tuning, training for a greater number of epochs,
feature engineering, or choosing a more complex algorithm. After a certain point, these
methods will become limited and provide a very small boost to the model's accuracy.
That is when data-centric approaches prove to be very efficient.

### 2. Data analysis as a precautionary step

By the principles of data-centric explainability approaches, at first, we try to perform
a thorough analysis of the underlying dataset. We try to randomly reshuffle the data to
create different training and validation sets and observe any overfitting or underfitting
effects. If the model is overfitting or underfitting, clearly more data is required to
generalize the model. If the available data is not sufficient in volume, there are ways
to generate synthetic or artificial data. One such popular technique used for image
classification is [data augmentation](https://research.aimultiple.com/data-augmentation/). The [Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/smote-oversampling-for-imbalanced-classification/) is also a powerful method that you can use
to increase the size of the dataset. Some of these data-centric approaches are usually
practiced during conventional ML workflows. However, we need to realize the importance
of these steps for the explainability of black-box models.

Once we have done enough tests to understand whether the volume of the data is
sufficient, we can try to inspect the consistency and purity of the data at a segmented level.
If we are working on a classification problem, we can try to understand whether the model
performance is consistent for all the classes. If not, we can isolate the particular class or
classes for which the model performance is poor. Then, we check for data drifts, feature
drifts, concept drifts, label ambiguity, data leakage (for example, when unseen test data
trickles into the training data), and other data integrity checks for that particular class
(or classes). Usually, if there is any abnormality with the data for a particular class (or
classes), these checks are sufficient to isolate the problem. A thorough data analysis acts as
a precautionary step to detect any loopholes in the modeling process.

### 3. Building robust data profiles

Another approach is to build statistical profiles of the data and then compare the profiles
between the training data and the inference data. A statistical profile of a dataset is
a collection of certain statistical measures of its feature values segmented by the target
variable class (or, in the case of a regression problem, the bin of values). The selection
of the statistical measures might change from use case to use case, but usually, I select
statistical measures such as the mean, median, average variance, average standard
deviation, coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean), and z-scores ((value â€“
mean)/standard deviation) for creating data profiles. In the case of time series data,
measures such as the moving average and the moving median can also be very important.

Next, let's try to understand how this approach is useful. Suppose there is an arbitrary
dataset that has three classes (namely class 0, 1, and 2) and only two features: feature 1 and
feature 2. When we try to prepare the statistical profile, we would try to calculate certain
statistical measures (such as the mean, median, and average variance in this example) for
each feature and each class.

So, for class 0, a set of profile values consisting of the mean of feature 1, the median of
feature 1, the average variance of feature 1, the mean of feature 2, the median of feature
2, and the average variance of feature 2 will be generated. Similarly, for class 1 and class
2, a set of profile values will be created for each class. The following table represents the
statistical profile of the arbitrary dataset that we have considered for this example:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-31.png?raw=true)

These statistical measures of the feature values can be used to compare the different
classes. If a trained model predicts a particular class, we can compare the feature values
with the statistical profile values for that particular class to get a fair idea about the
influential features contributing to the decision-making process of the model. But more
importantly, we can create separate statistical profiles for the validation set, test set, and
inference data used in the production systems and compare them with the statistical
profile of the training set. If the absolute percentage change between the values is
significantly higher (say, > 20%), then this indicates the presence of data drift.

In our example, let's suppose that if the absolute percentage change in the average
variance score for feature 1 for class 1 is about 25% between the training data and the
inference data, then we have a feature drift for feature 1, and this might lead to poor
model performance with the inference data for the production systems. Statistical profiles
can also be created for unstructured data such as images and text, although the choice of
statistical measures might be slightly complicated.

In general, this approach is very easy to implement and it helps us to validate whether the
data used for training a model and the data used during testing or inference are consistent
or not, which is an important step for data-centric model explainability. In the next
section, we will discuss about the importance of monitoring and anticipating drifts for
explaining ML systems.

## III. Monitoring and anticipating drifts

In the previous section, we understood how a thorough data analysis and data profiling
approach can help us to identify data issues related to volume, consistency, and purity.
Usually, during the initial data exploration process, most data scientists try to inspect
issues in the dataset in terms of volume and purity and perform necessary preprocessing
and feature engineering steps to handle these issues.

But the detection of data consistency for real-time systems and production systems is
a challenging problem for almost all ML systems. Additionally, issues relating to data
consistency are often overlooked and are quite unpredictable as they can happen at any
point in time in production systems. Some of the cases where data consistency issues can
occur are listed as follows:

- They can occur due to natural reasons such as changes in external environmental
conditions or due to the natural wear and tear of sensors or systems capturing the
inference data.

- They can happen due to human-induced reasons such as any physical damage
caused to the system collecting the data, any bug in the software program running
the algorithm due to which the input data is being transformed incorrectly, or any
noise introduced to the system while upgrading an older version of the system.

So, all of these situations can introduce data drifts and concept drifts, which eventually
lead to the poor performance of ML models. And since drifts are very common in reality,
issues related to drifts should be pre-anticipated and should be considered during the
design process of any ML system.

### 1. Detecting drifts

After trained models are deployed for any production ML system, performance
monitoring and feedback based on model performance is a necessary process. As we
monitor the model performance, checking for any data or concept drifts is also critical in
this step. At this point, you might be wondering two things:

- <i> What is the best way to identify the presence of a drift? </i>
- <i> What happens when we detect the presence of a drift? </i>


As discussed in the <i> Analyzing data consistency </i> section, there are two types of data drifts â€“
<i> feature drifts </i> and <i> concept drifts </i>. Feature drifts happen when the statistical properties of the
features or the independent variables change due to an unforeseen reason. In comparison,
concept drift occurs when the target class variable, which the model is trying to predict,
changes its initial relationship with the input features in a dynamic setting. In both cases,
there is a statistical change in the underlying data. So, my recommendation for detecting
drifts is to use the data profiling method discussed in the previous section.

A real-time monitoring dashboard is always helpful for any real-time application to
monitor any drift. In the dashboard, try to have necessary visualizations for each class
and each feature, comparing the statistical profile values with the actual live values
flowing into the trained model.

Particularly for concept drifts, comparing the correlations of the features with the target
outcome is extremely helpful. Since drifts can arise after a certain period of time or even
during a specific point in time due to external reasons, it is always advisable to monitor
the statistical properties of the inference data in a time window period (for instance,
for 50 consecutive data points or 100 consecutive data points) rather than a continuous
cumulative basis. For the purposes of feedback, necessary alerts and triggers can be set
when abnormal data points are detected in the inference data, which might indicate the
presence of data drift.

### 2. Selection of statistical measures

Sometimes, the selection of statistical measures can be difficult. So, we usually go for
some popular distribution metrics to detect the presence of data drift using a quantitative
approach. One such metric is called [trust score distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11783).

The following diagram shows the trust score distribution plot obtained using the
Deepchecks Python framework:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-32.png?raw=true)

Trust score is a distribution metric used to measure the agreement between the ML
classifier on the training set and an updated <b> k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) </b> classifier on the
inference dataset. The preceding diagram shows a trust score distribution plot between the
training dataset and the inference dataset.

Ideally, the distributions should be almost the same for both the train and test datasets.
However, if the trust score distribution for the inference set is skewed toward the extreme
left, this indicates that the trained model has less confidence in the inference data, thereby
alluding to the presence of drift. If the distribution of the trust score on the inference data
is skewed toward the extreme right, there might be some problem with the model and
there is a high probability of data leakage, as ideally, the trained model cannot be more
confident in the test data in comparison to the training data.

To detect feature drifts on categorical features, the popular choice of metric is the
[population stability index (PSI)](https://www.lexjansen.com/wuss/2017/47_Final_Paper_PDF.pdf). This is a statistical method used to measure the shift in a
variable over a period of time. If the overall drift score is more than 0.2 or 20%, then the
drift is considered to be significant, establishing the presence of feature drift.

To detect feature drifts in numeric features, the [Wasserstein metric](https://kowshikchilamkurthy.medium.com/wasserstein-distance-contraction-mapping-and-modern-rl-theory-93ef740ae867) is the
popular choice. This is a distance function for measuring the distance between two
probability distributions. Similar to PSI, if the drift score using the Wasserstein metric
is higher than 20%, this is considered to be significant and the numerical feature is
considered to have feature drift.

The following diagram illustrates feature drift estimation using the Wasserstein (Earth
Mover's) distance and <b> Predictive Power Score (PPS) </b> with the Deepchecks framework:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-33.png?raw=true)

Similar concept drifts can also be detected using these metrics. For regression
problems, the Wasserstein metric is effective, while for classification problems PSI is
more effective.

Now that we are aware of certain effective ways in which to detect drifts, <i> what do we do
when we have identified the presence of drifts? </i> The first step is to alert our stakeholders if
the ML system is already in production. Incorrect predictions due to data drift can impact
many end users, which might, ultimately, lead to the loss of trust of the end users. The
next step is to check whether the drift is <i> temporary </i>, <i> seasonal </i>, or <i> permanent </i> in nature.
Analysis of the nature of the drift can be challenging, but if the changes that are causing
the drift can be identified and reverted, then that is the best solution.

If the drift is temporary, the first step is to identify the temporary change that caused
the drift and then revert the changes. For seasonal drifts, seasonal changes to the data
should be accounted for during the training process or as an additional preprocessing
step to normalize any seasonal effects on the data. This is so that the model is aware of the
seasonal pattern in the data. However, if the drift is permanent, then the only option is to
retrain the model on the new data and deploy the newly trained model for the production
system.

In the context of XAI, the detection of drifts can justify the failure of any ML model or
algorithm and helps to improve the model by identifying the root cause of the failure. In
the next section, we will discuss another data-centric quality inspection step that can be
performed to ensure the robustness of ML models.

## VI. Checking adversarial robustness

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of anticipating and monitoring
drifts for any production-level ML system. Usually, this type of monitoring is done after
the model has been deployed in production. But even before the model is deployed in
production, it is extremely critical to check for the <b> adversarial robustness </b> of the model.

Most ML models are prone to adversarial attacks or an injection of noise to the input
data, causing the model to fail by making incorrect predictions. The degree of adversarial
attacks increases with the model's complexity, as complex models are very sensitive
to noisy data samples. So, checking for adversarial robustness is about evaluating how
sensitive the trained model is toward adversarial attacks.

In this section, first, we will try to understand the impact of adversarial attacks on the
model and why this is important in the context of XAI. Then, we will discuss certain
techniques that we can use to increase the adversarial robustness of ML models. Finally,
we will discuss the methods that are used to evaluate the adversarial robustness of models,
which can be performed as an exercise before deploying ML models into production, and
how this forms a vital part of explainable ML systems.

### 1. Impact of adversarial attacks

Over the past few years, adversarial attacks have been a cause of great concern for the
AI community. These attacks can inject noise to modify the input data in such a way
that a human observer can easily identify the correct outcome but an ML model can be
easily fooled and start predicting completely incorrect outcomes. The extent of the attack
depends on the attacker's access to the model.

Usually, in production systems, the trained model (especially the model parameters)
is fixed and cannot be modified. But the inference data flowing into the model can be
polluted with abrupt noise signals, thus making the model misclassify. Human experts
are extremely efficient in filtering out the injected noise, but ML models fail to isolate the
noise from the actual data if the model has not been exposed to such noisy samples during
the training phase. Sometimes, these attacks can be targeted attacks, too.

For example, if a face recognition system allows access to only a specific person,
adversarial attacks can modify the image of any person to a specific person by introducing
some noise. In this case, an adversarial algorithm would have to be trained using the
target sample to construct the noise signal. There are other forms of adversarial attacks
as well, which can modify the model during the training phase itself. However, since we
are discussing this in the context of XAI, we will concentrate on the impact of adversarial
effects on trained ML models.

There are different types of adversarial attacks that can impact trained ML models:

- <b> Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) </b>: FGSM is one such method that uses gradients
of deep learning models to learn adversarial samples. For image classifiers, this can
be a common problem, as FGSM creates perturbations on the pixel values of an
image by adding or subtracting pixel intensity values depending on the <i> direction of
the gradient descent </i> of the model. This can fool the model to misclassify and severely
affect the performance of the model, but it does not create any problem for a human
observer. Even if the modification appears to be negligible, the method adds an
evenly distributed noise that is enough to cause the misclassifications.

- <b> The Carlini & Wagner (C&W) attack </b>: Another common adversarial attack is the
C&W attack. This method uses the three norm-based distance metrics ($L_0$,$L_2$, and
$L_{\infinity}$) to find adversarial examples, such that the distance between the adversarial
example and the original sample is minimal. Detecting C&W attacks is more
difficult than FGSM attacks.

- <b> Targeted adversarial patch attacks </b>: Sometimes, injecting noise (that is, the
addition of noisy random pixels) into the entire image is not necessary. The
addition of a noisy image segment to only a small portion of the image can be
equally harmful to the model. Targeted adversarial patch attacks can generate a
small adversarial patch that is then superimposed with the original sample, thus
occluding the key features of the data and making the model classify incorrectly.
There are other forms of adversarial attacks too, and many more new methods can
be discovered in the future. However, the impact will still be the same.

The following diagram shows how different adversarial attacks can introduce noise in
an image, thereby making it difficult for the model to give correct predictions. Despite
the addition of noise, we, as human beings, can still predict the correct outcome, but the
trained model is completely fooled by adversarial attacks:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-34.png?raw=true)

Adversarial attacks can force an ML model to produce incorrect outcomes that can
severely affect end users. In the next section, let's try to explore ways to increase the
adversarial robustness of models.

### 2. Methods to increase adversarial robustness

In production systems, adversarial attacks can mostly inject noise into the inference data.
So, to reduce the impact of adversarial attacks, we would either need to teach the model to
filter out the noise or expose the presence of noisy samples during the training process or
train the models to detect adversarial samples:

- The easiest option is to filter out the noise as a defense mechanism to increase the
adversarial robustness of ML models. Any adversarial noise results in an abrupt
change in the input samples. In order to filter out any abrupt change from any
signal, we usually try to apply a smoothing filter such as <b> Spatial smoothing </b>. Spatial
smoothing is equivalent to the <b> blurring operation </b> in images and is used to reduce
the impact of the adversarial attack. From experience, I have observed that an
[adaptive median spatial smoothing](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/median.htm), which works at a local level through a windowing
approach is more effective than smoothing at a global level. The statistical measure
of the median is always more effective in filtering out noise or outliers from
the data.

- Another approach to increase adversarial robustness is by introducing
adversarial examples during the training process. By using the technique of <b> data
augmentation </b>, we can generate adversarial samples from the original data and
include the augmented data during the training process. If training the model
from scratch using augmented adversarial samples is not feasible, then the trained
ML model can actually be fine-tuned on the adversarial samples using <b> transfer
learning </b>. Here, the trained model weights can be taken to be fine-tuned on the
newer samples.

- The process of training a model with adversarial samples is often referred to
as <b> adversarial training </b>. We can even train a separate model using adversarial
training, just to detect adversarial samples from original samples, and use it
along with the main model to trigger alerts if adversarial samples are generated.
The idea of exposing the model to possible adversarial samples is similar to the
idea of [stress testing in cyber security](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6459909).

Figure below illustrates how spatial smoothing can be used as a defense mechanism to
minimize the impact of adversarial attacks:

![image](https://github.com/lacie-life/lacie-life.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/post_assest/XAI/xai-35.png?raw=true)

Using the methods that we have discussed so far, we can increase the adversarial
robustness of trained ML models to a great extent. In the next section, we will try to
explore ways to evaluate the adversarial robustness of ML models.

### 3. Evaluating adversarial robustness

Now that we have learned certain approaches in which to defend against adversarial
attacks, the immediate question that might come to mind is <i> how can we measure the
adversarial robustness of models? </i>

Unfortunately, I have never come across any dedicated metric to quantitatively measure
the adversarial robustness of ML models, but it is an important research topic for the
AI community. The most common approaches by which data scientists evaluate the
adversarial robustness of ML models are <b> stress testing </b> and <b> segmented stress testing </b>:

- In <b> stress testing </b>, adversarial examples are generated by FGSM or C&W methods.
Following this, the model's accuracy is measured on the adversarial examples and
compared to the model accuracy obtained with the original data. The strength of
the adversarial attack can also be increased or decreased to observe the variation of
the model performance with the attack strength. Sometimes, a particular class or
feature can become more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than the entire dataset. In
those scenarios, segmented stress testing is beneficial.

- In <b> segmented stress testing </b>, instead of measuring the adversarial robustness of
the entire model on the entire dataset, segments of the dataset (either for specific
classes or for specific features) are considered to compare the model robustness
with the adversarial attack strengths. Adversarial examples can be generated with
random noise or with Gaussian noise. For certain datasets, quantitative metrics
such as the [Peak Signal-to-Noise ratio (PSNR)](https://www.ni.com/nl-be/innovations/white-papers/11/peak-signal-to-noise-ratio-as-an-image-quality-metric.html) and [Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synthese (ERGAS)](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Erreur-Relative-Globale-Adimensionnelle-de-Synthese-ERGAS-values-of-fused-images_tbl1_248978216) are
used to measure the data or signal quality. Otherwise, the adversarial robustness
of ML models can be quantitatively inspected by the model's prediction of
adversarial samples.

More than the method of evaluating adversarial robustness, inspecting adversarial
robustness and monitoring the detection of adversarial attacks is an essential part
of explainable ML systems. Next, let's discuss the importance of measuring data
forecastability as a method to provide data-centric model explainability.

### V. Measuring data forecastability

So far, we have learned about the importance of analyzing data by inspecting its
consistency and purity, looking for monitoring drifts, and checking for any adversarial
attacks to explain the working of ML models. But some datasets are extremely complex
and, hence, training accurate models even with complex algorithms is not feasible. If the
trained model is not accurate, it is prone to make incorrect predictions. Now the question
is <i> how do we gain the trust of our end users if we know that the trained model is not
extremely accurate in making the correct predictions? </i>

I would say that the best way to gain trust is by being transparent and clearly
communicating what is feasible. So, measuring <b> data forecastability </b> and communicating
the model's efficiency to end users helps to set the right expectation.

Data forecastability is an estimation of the model's performance using the underlying
data. For example, let's suppose we have a model to predict the stock price of a particular
company. The stock price data that is being modeled by the ML algorithm can predict
the stock price with a maximum of 60% accuracy. Beyond that point, it is not practically
possible to generate a more accurate outcome using the given dataset.

But let's say that if other external factors are considered to supplement the current data,
the model's accuracy can be boosted. This proves that it is not the ML algorithm that is
limiting the performance of the system, but rather the dataset that is used for modeling
does not have sufficient information to get a better model performance. Hence, it is a
limitation of the dataset that can be estimated by measure of data forecastability.

The following diagram shows a number of model evaluation visualizations that can be
used to analyze data forecastability using the Deepchecks framework:

Next, let's discuss how to estimate data forecastability.

#### Estimating data forecastability

Data forecastability is estimated using the model evaluation metrics. Data forecastability
can also be measured by performing model error analysis. The choice of the metrics
depends on the type of dataset and the type of problem being solved. For example, take
a look at the following list:

- For time series data, data forecastability is obtained by metrics such as the <b> mean
absolute percentage error (MAPE) </b>, the <b> symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (SMAPE) </b>, the <b> coefficient of variation (CoV) </b>, and more.
- For classification problems, I usually go for <b> ROC-AUC Scores </b>, the <b> confusion
matrix, precision, recall </b>, and <b> F1 scores </b> along with <b> accuracy </b>.
- For regression problems, we can look at the <b> mean square error (MSE) </b>, the <b> R2
score </b>, the <b> root mean square error (RMSE) </b>, the <b> sum of squared errors (SSE) </b>,
and more.

You might have already used most of these metrics to evaluate trained ML models. Data
forecastability is not just about evaluating trained models according to your choice of
metric, but is the measure of predictability of the model using the given dataset.

Let's suppose you are applying three different ML algorithms such as decision trees,
support vector machine (SVM), and random forests for a classification problem, and
your choice of metric is recall. This is because your goal is to minimize the impact of false
positives. After rigorous training and validation on the unseen data, you are able to obtain
recall scores of 70% with decision tree, 85% with SVM, and 90% with random forest.
What do you think your data forecastability will be? Is it 70%, 90%, or 81.67% (the average
of the three scores)?

I would say that the correct answer is between 70% and 90%. It is always better to consider
forecastability as a ballpark estimate, as providing a range of values rather than a single
value gives an idea of the best-case and worst-case scenarios. Communicating about the
data forecastability increases the confidence of the end stakeholders in ML systems. If
the end users are consciously aware that the algorithm is only 70% accurate, they will not
blindly trust the model even if the system predicts incorrectly. The end users would be
more considerate if the model outcome does not match the actual outcome when they are
aware of the model's limitations.

Most ML systems in production have started using prediction probability or model
confidence as a measure of data forecastability, which is communicated to the end
users. For example, nowadays, most weather forecasting applications show that there
is a certain percentage of chance (or probability) for rainfall or snowfall. Therefore,
data forecastability increases the explainability of AI algorithms by setting up the right
expectation for the accuracy of the predicted outcome. It is not just the measure of the
model performance, but rather a measure of the predictability of a model which is trained
on a specific dataset.
