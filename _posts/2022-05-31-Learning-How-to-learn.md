## Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

- Metaphors provide powerful techniques for learning
- Focused and diffuse modes (relax, let your mind flow in diffuse mode, then think in focused)
- Learning something difficult takes time

## Procrastination, Memory, Sleep

- Use Pomodoro technique to avoid procrastination, useful for focusing (agree, it is much easier to focus on something, I’ve started to use this site on a regular basis)
- Practice makes permanent- neurons become linked together through <b> repeated use </b>
- Long term memory & working memory
- <b> Spaced repetition </b> - repeat what you’re trying to retain over a number of days, the chance to remember will be higher
-  Sleep:
+ cleans toxic products in your brain
+ erases the less important parts of memories
+ strengthens areas that you need or want to remember
- Learning by doing, by active engagement and not passive listening
- Smart != success; <b> passion + persistence = success </b>

## Chunking

- <b> focus </b> on something you’re learning
- <b> understand </b> the basic idea (understanding is like a glue to build and connect chunks)
- the first time you actually understand = the first time you can actually do it yourself
- learning = chunks ( <b> how </b> to do something) + context ( <b> when </b> to/not to use it)

## Illusions of competence

- <b> Recall </b> is the best learning technique (instead of passive readings)
- Minimize highlights- try to understand the main idea first and then highlight
- Notes and helpful words are great- add them
- Tests yourself= recall
- Interleaving is a great way to master a new subject (jump between different problems/situations, use different techniques/strategies)

## Focused learning

- Once a week write a brief weekly list of key tasks in a planner journal
- Daily “to do” list- frees working memory for problem-solving
- Make them as small as a pomodoro chunk
- Interleave (just between different topics)
- Planning your quitting time is as important as planning your working time
- Try to work on the most important and most disliked task first
