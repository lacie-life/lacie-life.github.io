# Paper note - [Week 6]

## [A customized residual neural network and bi-directional gated recurrent unit-based automatic speech recognition model](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119293)

### Motivation

- Voice technology is currently employed in many industries, allowing businesses and consumers to facilitate digitization and automation.

- Speech recognition is one of the most challenging computer science topics due to the difficulties of separating similar phonetically sentences and smearing problems.

### Contribution

- It proposes a stacked five layers of customized ResNets and seven
layers of Bi-GRUs, each including a layer normalization based on
a learnable element-wise affine parameters approach without the
requirement of external language models.

- The inclusion of the Gaussian error linear unit (GELU) layer and
the dense and dropout layers for the classification tasks showed
its worthiness in performance enhancement.

- It demonstrates that the volume of the training data significantly
affects the modelâ€™s output.
