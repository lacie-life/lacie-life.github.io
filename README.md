Welcome to Grape Academic Theme!
This theme is based on [Grape Theme](https://github.com/naye0ng/Grape-Theme) and modifies it to be more directly applicable as an academic portfolio page.
It can still include a blog, but that is optional.

[Demo](https://chrjabs.github.io/Grape-Academic-Theme)

## Features

Some of these features are optional and can be turned on or off in the `_config.yml` file.

### [Portfolio Homepage](https://chrjabs.github.io/Grape-Academic-Theme)

Portfolio page giving an overview of your research.

### [Publications List](https://chrjabs.github.io/Grape-Academic-Theme/publications)

A optional list of your publications auto-generated from a BibTeX file.
Additional information can be linked to from the BibTeX file.

### [Presentations List](https://chrjabs.github.io/Grape-Academic-Theme/presentations)

A optional list of your presentations auto-generated for a data file.

### [Blog](https://chrjabs.github.io/Grape-Academic-Theme/blog)

An optional blog for any posts you want to publish.

### [Hub Pages](https://chrjabs.github.io/Grape-Academic-Theme/example-hub)

Hub pages are intended for easy linking in your presentations.
They collect links and additional information related to your presentation so that you only have to put one link on your slides.
They can be manually generated or automatically from one of your publication entries.

## Installation and Serving Local Version for Testing

1. Fork and clone the Grape Academic Theme repo

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/chrjabs/Grape-Academic-Theme.git
   ```

2. Install Jekyll 

   ```
   gem install jekyll
   ```

3. Install the theme's dependencies

   ```
   bundle install
   ```

4. Update `_config.yml`, `_data/projects.yml`, `_data/projects.yml` and `_bibliography/publications.bib` with your own settings.

5. Run the Jekyll server

   ```
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

## Publishing

Grape-Academic-Theme uses jekyll-scholar and therefore needs to manually be published to GitHub pages.
A script for publishing on a `gh-pages` branch is included.
Run `_scripts/publish.sh` from the main project directory and the page will be built, copied to the `gh-pages` branch and published.
Make sure that GitHub pages is set up to publish that branch.
If additional scripts should be executed in the HTML root, they can be placed in `_scripts/publish.d` and will be automatically executed.

These are step-by-step instructions for forking and publishing the theme at your `<username>.github.io` github pages website:

1. For the repository to a repository named `<username>/<username>.github.io`
2. Go to the settings of the new repository and navigate to the "Pages" tab.
  There, change the source for github pages to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository.
3. Clone the repository and go through the installation steps listed above
4. In `_config.yml`, change the `baseurl` option to an empty string (`""`) to host the webpage in the root of your `github.io` page
5. Commit the change and (with a working jekyll install) run `_scripts/publish.sh`
6. _Wait a couple of minutes_ and the demo content will show up at `<username>.github.io`

## Customizing

Grape-Theme has two great features: the profile section and the project section of the portfolio page. Just by changing `_config.yml` and `projects.yml`, you can use all of these features.

### Feature Settings

The blog, publications, and presentations pages are optional and can be turned on or off in the config file.

### Favicon

Generate your favicons with [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and place them in the root directory.
The code to include them is already set up in the template.

### Site configuration

```
baseurl: "{subpath}"

theme_settings :
  title: {blog title}
```

### Profile Settings

Profile is displayed on the index page, and also experience and skills are displayed on the portfolio page.
